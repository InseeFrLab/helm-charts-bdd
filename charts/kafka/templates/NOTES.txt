- You can connect to this kafka only within the cluster itself.
- the connection string is : `{{ $fullname }}:{{ .Values.kafka.service.ports.client }}`
- example for producer python :

```
from confluent_kafka import Producer
import socket

conf = {'bootstrap.servers': "{{ $fullname }}:{{ .Values.kafka.service.ports.client }}",
        'client.id': socket.gethostname()}

producer = Producer(conf)
```

*NOTES about deletion :*

- **You can safely delete this chart and recreate one later**
- Data volumes will not be deleted
- If you start a new {{ .Chart.Name }}, it will reuse those volumes silently.
- If you want to delete those volume definitely : `kubectl delete pvc {{ join " " $pvcList }}`
