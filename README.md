# Helm charts BDD

This collection of Helm Charts is tailored for datascientists !
It is primarly designed to work with [Onyxia](https://github.com/inseefrlab/onyxia) but also works as a standalone Helm repository.  
See the other repository ([Helm charts](https://github.com/inseefrlab/helm-charts-datascience-internal)) for interactive focused charts.  

To use the repo on helm (version 3+) :
```
helm repo add inseefrlab-datascience https://inseefrlab.github.io/helm-charts-bdd
```  

The repo is also browsable directly https://inseefrlab.github.io/helm-charts-bdd/index.yaml

Contributions are welcome, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests :)
